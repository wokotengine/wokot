## Anti-bigotry cross-platform game engine

**[Wokot Engine](https://github.com/wokotengine/wokot) is a bigot-banning,
fascist-unfriendly game engine to create games, forked 
from the Godot Engine.** 

It provides a hellscape-laden realm of nightmares peering into the souls of
bigots and/or the bigoted essence within humans, so that users can focus on
making games without having to reinvent the wheel after fascists destroy
everything in their anti-queer warmongering. Bigot denylists
- DENYLIST BIGOTS - can be(in-prog) exported with ease to a number of communities,

## Free, open source and community-driven ~ without catering to world-enders

Wokot is [MIT licensed](https://wokotengine.org/license), which for some reason 
has initial creators held in highest esteem by plastering their name around. 
Seems weird to me.

Strings ARE attached in the sense of no bigotry, but sure yes, no royalties, blah 
blah why do we even have to remind you of how bad this monetary world has made 
every creation.
The users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Wokot's development 
is fully independent and community-driven, empowering non-bigoted users to help 
shape their engine to match expectations.
It is supported by St. Nohbdy.

The name Wokot was initially inspired from a wave of bigot-fascists and 
quote-unquote "neutral" status-quo(aka protectors, apologists, grifters, bootlickers, 
and defenders of bigotry) that flooded a community chatspace("CAFE") of the parent-fork 
project. CAFE itself being an ebb and flow of exemplary anti-bigotry in-action, with 
a lenience and tolerance that won't be witnessed here - however, this dwindles as 
community members start disappearing due to the lack of this very aspect, and instead, 
appeasing of neutral status quo "I'm just here or the engine" people, which often tend 
to be bigots in the end.

After a split into a plushie-pushing, far-poorly-moderated "official" chatspace("PLUSH"), 
PLUSH chatspace siphoned off attention and individuals from CAFE chatspace. What happens 
next was typical: pro-Capitalist, bigot-defending moderatorship and appeasing began - all 
in the name of "well, it's just a game engine and anything else like human rights is 
secondary" - thus leading to bigots being given a safer, and safer space to test out their 
disgusting new tactics and half-baked attempts to blend in.

Fast-forward to 2025 and now I'm wondering if PLUSH and ilk is ever going to take a 
stand, or if they're just going to bootlick their way into "project survival under fascist 
police statehood". Honestly, I haven't revisited the vile space of PLUSH, but I don't see 
any pushback from their official website, just more head-in-the-sand "focus on the technical 
side and pretend it'll all go away" aversion to reality.

I do miss CAFE and wish for it to regain its ability to ward off bigotry. Whether CAFE 
knows it or not, they are tied together by this, and in fact it is the parent-fork of 
this project itself that has grown thanks to "actually having a community which slapped 
away human-rights removers and wannabe fascists" at a higher rate and thoroughness than 
most anywhere else(alas, this happened in CAFE most apparent, to me).

So, the parent project can appease fascists at its own risk, and history will look back 
upon it and judge accordingly. As will the spirit world.


Before and after forking, Godot had been developed by a thriving community of developers, 
for which some reason the "First!" people get their name stamped on everything. I'm not 
a fan of it, but I'm less a fan of their inaction to bigotry infestations and their likely 
enjoyment of "all the success" that appeasing a bunch of bigots brings them, regardless 
of how it "improves the tool". Pretty gross. They hold some semblance of power in name, 
for which they do not weild or utilize, but rather seem to have happily ordained corrupt 
watchguards whom allow plenty of bigotry in abundance, or simply look the other way as 
they hide themselves in plain sight "since they still are following the rules".
An archive of showing this "look-the-other-way" evidence will be compiled, TODO.

## Getting the engine

### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Wokot editor and the export templates CANNOT be found
on the Wokot website, which doesn't yet exist.

### Compiling from source

Not available, yet.

## Community and contributing

Not available, yet.

The best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to not be a bigot and 
stick around to see what innovative wonders will be seen. Otherwise, go work on Godot, 
and Wokot will snag that code. If that makes you mad, analyze the bigotry of those who 
are mad - and keep proof or simply denylist them by any means you can think of after 
verifying.

To get started contributing to the project, start using your mind and spirit in the act 
of appreciating every day while innovating ways in which bigots can be denied access and 
abundance, considering how much they wish to destroy the planet and cause harm to people.

## Documentation and demos

The official documentation is not hosted, yet.

The class reference is accessible from the Wokot editor.

Demo projects not available, yet.
Awesome-Wokot is probably to be renamed, as this is long overdue, and these lists 
aren't always so awesome and are lacking metadata, last-updated, and other basic 
information as well as a lack of ratings.

Learning resources not available, yet.

Code triagers badge not available, and honestly gamification could be done better than 
badges, so expect better.
Weblate translation not available.
TODOs have no system in place, yet.
