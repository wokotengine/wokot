## Anti-bigotry cross-platform game engine

**[Wokot Engine](https://wokotengine.org) is a bigot-banning, fascist-unfriendly game engine to create games, forked from the Godot Engine.** It provides a hellscape-laden realm of nightmares peering into the souls of bigots and/or the bigoted essence within humans, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel after fascists destroy everything in their anti-queer warmongering. Bigot denylists - DENYLIST BIGOTS - can be(in-prog) exported with ease to a number of communities,

## Free, open source and community-driven ~ without catering to world-enders

Wokot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://wokotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Wokot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering non-bigoted users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by St. Nohbdy, and

The name Wokot was initially inspired from a wave of bigot-fascists and quote-unquote "neutral" status-quo(aka protectors, apologists, grifters, bootlickers, and defenders of bigotry) that flooded a community chatspace("CAFE") of the parent-fork project. This community space itself being an ebb and flow of showing how to properly handle bigotry - with a lenience and tolerance that won't be witnessed here. After a split into a plushie-pushing, far-poorly-moderated "official" chatspace("PLUSH") - which siphoned off attention and individuals from 'CAFE' - the typical, pro-Capitalist, bigot-defending moderatorship and appeasing began - all in the name of "well, it's just a game engine and anything else like human rights is secondary" - thus leading to bigots being given a safer, and safer space to test out their disgusting new tactics and half-baked attempts to blend in.

Before it's parent-fork being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/wokotengine/wokot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Wokot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.
